Description: EAPOL Proxy Daemon
 peapod is a daemon that proxies IEEE 802.1X Extensible
 Authentication Protocol over LAN (EAPOL) packets between Ethernet
 interfaces.
 .
 .
 It supports a few tricks on a per-interface basis, so it may be
 considered a (highly) rudimentary general-purpose
 transparent bridging firewall/rewriting proxy for EAPOL.
