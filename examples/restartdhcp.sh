# Description: Example script for peapod - EAPOL Proxy Daemon
#
# When run by peapod as the result of receiving EAP-Success on a
# specific ingress interface, restart the system's DHCP client (dhclient
# in this example) on that interface. Exit with different nonzero exit
# codes upon encountering errors; peapod will report them to the user.

# Interface with running dhclient instance
